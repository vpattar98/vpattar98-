### 🌟 Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!

I’m passionate about solving real-world problems with data, exploring new tools and technologies, and helping others thrive in the tech space. This is my little space where I:

- 📊 Share projects focused on data analytics, automation, and dashboarding  
- 💡 Drop insights from my experiences with tools like Power BI, SQL, and Python  
- 🛠️ Learn in public—because growth is better when shared

**Whether you're here to dive into code, share insights, or simply see what’s brewing—thank you for stopping by! 👋**

I'll bring the queries—let’s connect, collaborate, and grow together, one commit at a time.
